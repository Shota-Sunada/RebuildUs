    "Bait": "The Bait is a Crewmate that if killed, forces the killer to self report the body (you can configure a delay in the options).\nAdditionally, the Bait can see if someone is inside a vent (depending on the options the exact vent gets an outline or all vents do).",

    "Impostor": "You are regular Impostor.",
    "BountyHunter": "The Bounty Hunter is an Impostor, that continuously get bounties (the targeted player doesn't get notified).\nThe target of the Bounty Hunter swaps after every meeting and after a configurable amount of time.\nIf the Bounty Hunter kills their target, their kill cooldown will be a lot less than usual.\nKilling a player that's not their current target results in an increased kill cooldown.\nDepending on the options, there'll be an arrow pointing towards the current target.",

If the Engineer is inside a vent, the Impostors will see a\nblue outline around all vents on the map (in order to warn them).\nBecause of the vents the Engineer might not be able to start some tasks using the\n\"Use\" button, you can double click on the tasks instead.",
    "Eraser": "The Eraser is an Impostor that can erase the role of every player.\nThe targeted players will lose their role after the meeting right before a player is exiled.\nAfter every erase, the cooldown increases by 10 seconds.\nThe erase will be performed, even if the Eraser or their target die before the next meeting.\nBy default the Eraser can erase everyone but the Spy and other Impostors. Depending on the options you can also erase them (Impostors will lose their special Impostor ability).",
    "EvilGuesser": "The Guesser can be a Crewmate or an Impostor (depending on the settings).\nThe Guesser can shoot a player during the meeting, by guessing its role.\nIf the guess is wrong, the Guesser dies instead.\nYou can select how many players can be shot per meeting and how many players can be shot per game.\nThe guesses Impostor and Crewmate are only right, if the player is part of the corresponding team and has no special role.\nYou can only shoot during the voting time.",

The Sidekick loses their current role (except if they're a Lover, then they play in two teams).\nThe \"Create Sidekick Action\" may only be used once per Jackal or once per game (depending on the options).\nThe Jackal can also promote Impostors to be their Sidekick, but depending on the options the Impostor will either really turn into the Sidekick and leave the team Impostors or they will just look like the Sidekick to the Jackal an remain as they were.",

    "Medic": "The Medic can shield (highlighted by an outline around the player) one player per game,which makes the player unkillable.\nThe shielded player can still be voted out and might also be an Impostor.\nIf set in the options, the shielded player will get a red flash on their screen if someone (Impostor, Sheriff, ...) tried to murder them.\nIf the Medic dies, the shield disappears with them.\nThe Sheriff will not die if they try to kill a shielded Crewmate and won't perform a kill if they try to kill a shielded Impostor.\nThe Medic's other feature shows when they report a corpse: they will see how long ago the player died.",
    "Medium": "The Medium is a crewmate who can ask the souls of dead players for information.\nLike the Seer, it sees the places where the players have died (after the next meeting) and can question them.

The souls only stay for one round, i.e. until the next meeting.\nDepending on the options, the souls can only be questioned once and then disappear.",
    "Morphing": "The Morphing is an Impostor which can additionally scan the appearance of a player. After an arbitrary time they can take on that appearance.",
    "NiceGuesser": "The Guesser can be a Crewmate or an Impostor (depending on the settings).\nThe Guesser can shoot a player during the meeting, by guessing its role.\nIf the guess is wrong, the Guesser dies instead.\nYou can select how many players can be shot per meeting and how many players can be shot per game.\nThe guesses Impostor and Crewmate are only right, if the player is part of the corresponding team and has no special role.\nYou can only shoot during the voting time.",

    "Seer": "The Seer has two abilities (one can activate one of them or both in the options).\nThe Seer sees the souls of players that died a round earlier, the souls slowy fade away.\nThe Seer gets a blue flash on their screen, if a player dies somewhere on the map.",

    "Shifter": "The Shifter can take over the role of another Crewmate, the other player will transform into a Crewmate.\nThe Shift will always be performed at the end of the next meeting right before a player is exiled. The target needs to be chosen during the round.\nEven if the Shifter or the target dies before the meeting, the Shift will still be performed.\nSwapping roles with an Impostor or Neutral fails and the Shifter commits suicide after the next meeting (there won't be any body).\nThe Shifter aims to save roles from leaving the game, by e.g. taking over a Sheriff or\nMedic that is known to the Impostors.\nThis works especially well against the Eraser, but also gives the Eraser the possibility to act like a Shifter.",
    "Sidekick": "Gets assigned to a player during the game by the \"Create Sidekick Action\" of the Jackal and joins the Jackal in their quest to eliminate all other players.\nUpon the death of the Jackal (depending on the options), they might get promoted to Jackal themselves and potentially even assign a Sidekick of their own.",

    "Spy": "The Spy is a Crewmate, which has no special abilities.\nThe Spy looks like an additional Impostor to the Impostors, they can't tell the difference.\nThere are two possibilities (depending on the set options):\n- The Impostors can't kill the Spy (because otherwise their kill button would reveal who the Spy is)\n- The Impostors can kill the Spy but they can also kill their Impostor partner (if they mistake another Impostor for the Spy)\nYou can set whether the Sheriff can kill the Spy or not (in order to keep the lie alive).",
    "NiceSwapper": "During meetings the Swapper can exchange votes that two people get (i.e. all votes that player A got will be given to player B and vice versa).\nBecause of the Swappers strength in meetings, they might not start emergency\n meetings and can't fix lights and comms.",

    "TimeMaster": "The Time Master has a time shield which they can activate.\nThe time shield remains active for a configurable amount of time.\nIf a player tries to kill the Time Master while the time shield is active,the kill won't happen and the time will rewind for a set amount of time.\nThe kill cooldown of the killer won't be reset, so the Time Master has to make sure that the game won't result in the same situation.\nThe Time Master won't be affected by the rewind.",
    "Tracker": "The Tracker can select one player to track.\nDepending on the options the Tracker can track a different person after each meeting or the Tracker tracks the same person for the whole game.\nAn arrow points to the last tracked position of the player.\nThe arrow updates it's position every few seconds (configurable).",

Lights are automatically restored after a while.",
    "Vampire": "The Vampire is an Impostor, that can bite other player. Bitten players die after a configurable amount of time.\nIf the Vampire spawn chance is greater 0 (even if there is no Vampire in the game), all players can place one garlic.\nIf a victim is near a garlic, the \"Bite Button\" turns into the default \"Kill Button\" and the Vampire can only perform a normal kill.",
    "Vulture": "The Vulture does not have any tasks, he has to win the game as a solo.\nThe Vulture is a neutral role that must eat a specified number of corpses (depending on the options) in order to win.\nDepending on the options, when a player dies, the Vulture gets an arrow pointing to the corpse.",
    "Warlock": "The Warlock is an Impostor, that can curse another player (the cursed player doesn't get notified).\nIf the cursed person stands next to another player, the Warlock is able to kill that player (no matter how far away they are).\nPerforming a kill with the help of a cursed player, will lift the curse and it will result in the Warlock being unable to move for a configurable amount of time.\nThe Warlock can still perform normal kills, but the two buttons share the same cooldown.",
    "Witch": "The Witch is an Impostor who has the ability to cast a spell on other players.\nDuring the next meeting, the spellbound player will be highlighted and they'll die\nright after the meeting.",
